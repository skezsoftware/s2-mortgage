            <h3>Reduce Your Rate and Save Money</h3>
            <p>
              A rate/term refinance involves replacing your current mortgage
              with a new one, typically to secure better terms. Here&apos;s why
              you might consider it:
            </p>
            <ul className="serviceCard-list">
              <li>Lower Interest Rate</li>
              <li>Lower Your Payment</li>
              <li>Improve Loan Features</li>
              <li>Adjust Your Loan Term</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A rate/term refinance can help you save money and better match
              your mortgage to your financial situation. Take special note if
              you have a VA or FHA loan, we can complete your refinance without
              requiring an appraisal or income documentation, saving you
              additional time and money.

              by replacing your current mortgage with a new one for a higher
              amount. Here are some reasons why it might be a good option:
