              A rate/term refinance involves replacing your current mortgage
              with a new one, typically to secure better terms. Here's why you

            <ul className="serviceCard-list">

              <li>Adjust Your Loan Term</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A rate/term refinance can help you save money and better match
              your mortgage to your financial situation. Take special note if
              you have a VA or FHA loan, we can complete your refinance without
              requiring an appraisal or income documentation, saving you
              additional time and money.
