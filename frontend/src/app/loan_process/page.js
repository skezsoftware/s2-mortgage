        <h1>The Stages of a Home Loan</h1>
        <h2>For Home Buyers</h2>
        <p>
          Navigating the home loan process can seem daunting, but understanding

          guide you through every step, ensuring you have the support you need

      <div>
        <h2>Pre-Approval</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IT IS:</h3>
        <p>
          Once you’ve picked a home, you’ll need to fill out a loan application
          with details about your income, assets, and debts.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY IT MATTERS:</h3>
        <p>
          Getting pre-approved shows you your budget and strengthens your offer
          on a home.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Find a Home</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IT IS:</h3>
        <p>
          Once you’ve picked a home, you’ll need to fill out a loan application
          with details about your income, assets, and debts.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY IT MATTERS:</h3>
        <p>
          It helps you move forward with confidence and a clear understanding of
          your price range.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Underwriting</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IT IS:</h3>
        <p>
          During underwriting, the lender will review your application,
          financial documents, and property details to confirm your loan
          eligibility.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY IT MATTERS:</h3>
        <p>
          This stage ensures the information provided is accurate & meets the
          lending criteria, helping to prevent any surprises later on.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Loan Approval</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IT IS:</h3>
        <p>
          After underwriting, you’ll get formal loan approval with the terms and
          conditions. We’ll then finalize the details and prepare for closing.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY IT MATTERS:</h3>
        <p>
          Loan approval confirms that you are set to proceed with the purchase
          of your home, pending any final conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Closing</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IT IS:</h3>
        <p>
          Closing is the final step where you sign the documents, pay any
          remaining fees, and officially buy the home.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY IT MATTERS:</h3>
        <p>
          Successful closing means you’re officially a homeowner! It’s the
          culmination of all the hard work and preparation you’ve put in.
